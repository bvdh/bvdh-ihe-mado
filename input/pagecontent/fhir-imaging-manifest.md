The FHIR imaging manifest represents a summary of the data stored in a DICOM imaging study as is stored in a PACS expressed in FHIR. It is the FHIR equivalent of the DICOM KOS manifest. It is the '*document*' that is searched for and provides the URL's that allow download of the imaging content. 

### FHIR Manifest overview

The figure below presents an overview of the data that is part of the imaging-manifest. In order to keep the diagram readable, not all references are included.

The manifest is a FHIR bundle that SHALL conform to the {{MadoFhirBundle}} profile. This `Bundle` includes the {{MadoImagingStudy}} resource, the {{DeviceAuthor}}, at least one {{Endpoint}} and additional resources. The `Bundle` SHALL contain all available data elements in the FHIR column in Table 4.3-1 (see [DICOM KOS <-> FHIR mappings](mapping.html)).

{% include stunote.html text="Feedback is requested from the implementer community whether we need to highlight these fields more explicitly and how (e.g. using FHIR obligations)."%}

{{Endpoint}} resources contain the information that allows the client to access the DICOM data. The current model identifies two different {{Endpoint}}s:

* The {{MadoWadoEndpoint}} endpoint which provides a WADO endpoint corresponding the WADO profile defined in this specification.
* The {{MadoXcWadoEndpoint}} endpoint which provides an {{iheXcWado}} endpoint corresponding the {{iheXcWado}} specification.

The {{DeviceAuthor}} profile provides information on the system that generated the manifest.

Besides the {{ImagingStudy}} and {{Endpoint}} resources, also additional resources are present that reflect information present in DICOM such as information on the patient, performer, procedure and imaging device. What resources to include depends on the information to be included, see [DICOM KOS <-> FHIR mappings](mapping.html) for more information on when to include what resource.
